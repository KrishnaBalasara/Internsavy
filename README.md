Here, is the Task that I have completed in my Virtual Internship in Java development at Internsavy.
In this, I have done a total of 3 Tasks.

## Task 1 - Currency Converter:

- During the First task, I developed a Currency Converter application using JavaFX. The application allows users to easily convert currencies between INR, USD, JPY, GBP, and EUR. The application's user-friendly interface enables users to input the amount in one currency and choose another currency for conversion.

## Task 2 - Tic Tac Toe Game:

- During the Second task, I created an engaging Tic Tac Toe game using JavaFX in the second task. The game is designed for two players to compete against each other. It provides a dynamic game board where players can take turns placing their respective symbols (X and O). The application also features a scoreboard that keeps track of the players' scores, updating after each game. At the end of a game, players can continue playing or quit the game.

## Task 3 - Employee Management System (CRUD Operations):

- During the Third task, I developed an Employee Management System that performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Using Java, I designed a user-friendly system where administrators can efficiently manage employee details. This includes adding employee information such as name, ID, email, contact, position, and experience. The system also supports updating employee details and removing employees when necessary.
